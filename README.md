# InternCareer: Data Science Tasks
Repo for my tasks for the data science internship with InternCareer

## Task 1: YouTube Streamer Analysis
- **Dataset:** Top 1000 Youtubers statistics
- **Description:** This dataset contains valuable information about the top YouTube streamers, including their ranking, categories, subscribers, country, visits, likes, comments, and more. Your task is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the dataset to extract insights about the top YouTube content creators.
- **Tools Used:** R Programming

### Approach
In order to solve this task, I had to take time to actually understand what the problem was and how I would go about it. The following was how I approached the projects:
1. First figured out what too I would use. Would it be R? Python? Tableau? or Power BI?
2. Once I had the tool selected, **R**, I then had to decide whether I would use RStudio, Posit Cloud, Juptyer Notebook or Kaggle and I ended up choosing to go with Kaggle for my platform of choice.

## Task 2: Power BI Dashboard Creation - Terrorism Database
- **Dataset:** Terrorism Database
- **Description:** The Terrorism Database contains information about terrorist attacks worldwide. It includes details such as the date, location, attack type,
weapons used, number of casualties, and responsible groups. Your task is to create a Power BI dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of global terrorism trends and patterns.
